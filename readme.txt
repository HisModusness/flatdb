FlatDB.

As with last time, this program contains the functionality of the two previous assignments in addition to the current one. You will find the specific enhancements in the thread_info struct, and the functions run_threaded() and run_threaded_worker(), all in main.c. All other code remains unchanged. To run this program in threaded demonstration mode, invoke it as:

./a.out -t path/to/database
